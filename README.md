Spree Homepage Images
===================

Spree Homepage Images adds an administration screen to upload and order images as well as adding a homepage onto the site that cycles through images using the nivo-slider (http://nivo.dev7studios.com/).  Since Home has now changed an additional menu item next to the default home is added for 'Products' to allow navigating to the products section or back to home.

This extension was designed with Spree 1.0 so not currently backward compatible.


Installation
===================
Standard spree extension install method.
